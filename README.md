# 🌐 Network Topology Simulator

A graphical desktop application built using **Tkinter** and **NetworkX** that allows users to visualize and simulate data flow across different types of network topologies, such as **Star**, **Bus**, **Ring**, **Mesh**, and **Tree**.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🖱️ Interactive GUI using **Tkinter**
- 🧠 Visualizes five key network topologies
- 🔁 Simulates data flow by animating edge traversal
- 📊 Graph rendering using **Matplotlib** integrated in the GUI
- 🧩 Modular design — easy to extend or customize

**## 🚀 Getting Started**

**### 🔧 Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:

git clone https://github.com/harshith1729/Network-Simulator.git
cd Network-Simulator

**2. Install required packages:**

pip install matplotlib networkx

**3. Running the App**

python simulator.py


**🧠 Supported Topologies**

🌟 Star Topology: One central node connected to all others.

🚍 Bus Topology: Nodes connected in a linear sequence.

🔄 Ring Topology: Each node connected to exactly two others, forming a ring.

🕸️ Mesh Topology: Every node is connected to every other node.

🌳 Tree Topology: Hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships.

****🧪 How It Works****

-->Select a topology from the dropdown.

-->Click “Draw Topology” to visualize the structure.

-->Click “Simulate Data Flow” to animate data transfer through edges (edges turn red one-by-one).
